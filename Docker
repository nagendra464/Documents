* Docker is a container management service. The keywords of Docker are develop, ship and run anywhere. 
* Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

------Features of Docker-----------------------

* Docker has the ability to reduce the size of development by providing a smaller footprint of the operating system via containers.

* With containers, it becomes easier for teams across different units, such as development, QA and Operations to work seamlessly across applications.

* You can deploy Docker containers anywhere, on any physical and virtual machines and even on the cloud.

* Since Docker containers are pretty lightweight, they are very easily scalable.

------------shows the standard and traditional architecture of virtualization.-----------------

* The server is the physical server that is used to host multiple virtual machines.

* The Host OS is the base machine such as Linux or Windows.

* The Hypervisor is either VMWare or Windows Hyper V that is used to host virtual machines.

* You would then install multiple operating systems as virtual machines on top of the existing hypervisor as Guest OS.

* You would then host your applications on top of each Guest OS.

------------------shows the new generation of virtualization that is enabled via Dockers--------

* The server is the physical server that is used to host multiple virtual machines. So this layer remains the same.

* The Host OS is the base machine such as Linux or Windows. So this layer remains the same.

* Now comes the new generation which is the Docker engine. This is used to run the operating system which earlier used to be virtual machines as Docker containers.

* All of the Apps now run as Docker containers.

NOTE : Docker engine is that it is designed to work on various operating systems

* CMD Instruction
This command is used to execute a command at runtime when the container is executed.

* ENTRYPOINT
This command can also be used to execute commands at runtime for the container. But we can be more flexible with the ENTRYPOINT command.
